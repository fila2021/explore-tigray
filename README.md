## 💡 UX Rationale

- **Consistency**: Navbar fixed at the top, consistent layout.
- **Clarity**: Overlay ensures text contrast in hero section.
- **Accessibility**: Labels, aria-live for chatbot, keyboard (Enter key) support.
- **Interactivity**: Search, filter, map, and chatbot help users achieve goals.
- **Feedback**: Clear “No results found” messages, chatbot fallback, map error banner.

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Step-by-step)

1. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `index.html` with your own Google Maps API key.
2. Ensure `index.html` and `404.html` are in the repo root.
3. Add a **blank** `.nojekyll` file at the repo root.
4. Push changes to `main` branch.
5. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Source → main / root**.
6. Wait a few minutes and visit your URL:
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
7. If 404 occurs, test `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/404.html` → it should auto-redirect to home.

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- All images include **alt text**.
- Sufficient **color contrast**.
- Keyboard accessible navigation.
- Form elements have **labels**.

---

### Bug Log

- **GitHub Pages 404** – Found: GitHub Pages returned 404.
  Fix: Added `.nojekyll` → resolved.
- **Map InfoWindow Bug** – Found: marker click error.
  Fix: corrected `infoWindow.open(map, marker)` → resolved.
- **Inline Styles** – Found: chatbot used inline `style`.
  Fix: moved to CSS classes → resolved.

🧪 Responsiveness Testing

The site was tested across multiple devices and screen sizes using Responsive Design Checker
.

✅ 1400px (Desktop) – Hero section, navbar, and grid layouts display correctly.

✅ 1024px (Laptop/Tablet Landscape) – Destinations align neatly, navigation remains accessible.

✅ 768px (Tablet Portrait) – Cards stack into two columns, hero text scales properly.

✅ 375px (Mobile) – Single-column layout, navbar collapses into hamburger menu, map and form are scrollable.

## 🐛 Known Issue: GitHub Pages 404 Bug

During deployment, the project encountered a **GitHub Pages 404 issue**, even though:

- The repository structure is correct (`index.html` at root).
- Pages settings are correctly configured (branch: `main`, folder: `/root`).
- A `.nojekyll` file was added to disable Jekyll processing.
- GitHub Actions build logs show a successful deployment (green check ✅).

The 404 error on the live URL:
👉 [https://fila2021.github.io/explore-tigray/](https://fila2021.github.io/explore-tigray/)

is resolved.

### Investigation

- Cleared browser cache, tested incognito, and waited >10 minutes after deploy.
- Confirmed correct repo branch and Pages configuration.
- Attempted forced rebuild (switching to `/docs` then back to `/root`).
- No issues in GitHub Actions build logs.

### Conclusion

This appears to be a **GitHub Pages bug**, not an issue with the project code or repo structure. The full site works correctly in local development (via `index.html`) and passes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript validation. The issue is resolved for me but incase if it happens for you, follow te workaround instruction below.

### Workaround

For assessment:

- Please clone the repo locally and open `index.html` in a browser.
- All features (search, filter, map) work as expected.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- User **authentication** for personalized favorites.
- Expand with **AI-powered chatbot** for travel guidance.
- Add more **categories** (e.g., trekking routes, events).
- Integration with a **real backend** for saving feedback.
